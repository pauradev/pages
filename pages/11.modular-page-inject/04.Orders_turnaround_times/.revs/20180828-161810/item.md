<h2>Order Edits/Cancellations</h2>
You are only able to edit or cancel your order when the status is still displays “New” or "On Hold". Once the order goes into processing you can no longer edit or cancel the order. If the order is processing and you need to make a change please <a title="Contact" href="https://printaura.com/contactus/">contact us</a> about your changes. We do our best to meet your request but once it starts processing we can’t guarantee that it can be edited or canceled.
<h2>Stock Issues</h2>
99.44% of our orders are completed without any stock issues. However, due to our dynamic and fast moving inventory, we do experience stock issues from time to time.
<h3>So what happens if an item isn't in stock?</h3>
<strong>Notification</strong>
We will notify you via email that an item in one of your orders is out of stock.

<strong>Substitution</strong>
There are usually comparable substitute items for most of our products. At this point you can look through our product offerings and choose a similar item, or contact your customer to see what they would prefer. If you do decide to substitute the item, we can print out your design onto the new item and ship it out, no problem!

If there is not a suitable replacement item, or if you just don't want to substitute, we can cancel the order the order for you. Unfortunately we do not do back orders.
