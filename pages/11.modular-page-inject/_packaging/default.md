You might be wondering, "What will my customers receive in their packages shipped from Printaura"? The contents of the packages vary depending on what options you have selected in our branding services. For this example, we will include what is shipped in a basic package with no branding services activated.

* The Shipping Package
* What's Inside Of The Package:
* A Garment Care Card
* A Custom Packing Slip
* The Item The Customer Ordered
* Optional Branding Services

Along with the above, you can activate a variety of branding services to include more items in your shipments.
