You might be wondering, "What will my customers receive in their packages shipped from Printaura"? The contents of the packages vary depending on what options you have selected in our branding services. For this example, we will include what is shipped in a basic package with no branding services activated.

**The Shipping Package**

Most garments are shipped in white polymailers. A shipping label is added that will have a return label featuring your business name and either your address or ours depending on your settings.
