## Payment Process

Print Aura's payment process is very simple! You make a sale, you get paid by your customer, then you pay us to fulfill that order for you. They are two separate billing transactions but they can be completely automated. 

**Payment Process**

You Make A Sale

Someone buys something from your shop. They pay you for the full price of the item.
You Pay Print Aura

You pay Print Aura to print and ship out the product.
We Print & Ship

Print Aura prints and ships out all orders that have been included in your payment.

**Billing Options**

In order for us to be able to fulfill your customer's order, we need to receive payment. We accept most major credit cards and Paypal. There are two easy options for paying for your orders.

**Setup Automatic Payments**

You can setup auto payments and not have to worry about a thing. When the order enters Print Aura we will charge your credit card or Paypal account for the exact amount of the order. Setup Auto Payments

**Manually Deposit Funds**

If an order is sent to us and you do not have automatic billing setup we will send you an email that your order will be on hold and not processed until payment is made. You will be prompted to deposit funds into your Print Aura account by credit card or Paypal.
