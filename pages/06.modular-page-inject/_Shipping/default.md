[**Shipping**](https://blog.printaura.com/modular-page-inject/shipping)

Items that are on a separate line are shipped in separate packages due to the nature of the how the products are packaged and shipped. The exception are sweatshirts which can ship with t-shirts, bags, and beanies
* Tracking:
Tracking is provided on ALL orders. However, tracking is only valid when in the US. Once the package leaves the US for international orders it will not update.
* Shipping Packaging:
Most packages are shipped in basic white poly bags. There is no branding on the packages, just the return label that features your business name.
* Return Labels:
On the return label we can use any US address you provide or just use our mailing address ( 2 Wurz Ave. Yorkville NY 13495). Due to USPS rules you are unable to use an international address.
