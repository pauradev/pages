[**Sales Tax**](https://blog.printaura.com/modular-page-inject/sales_tax)

Formerly the burden was on the customer rather than the seller to pay the relevant tax. In that case, the tax generally is called use tax rather than sales tax â€“ and customers often simply did not pay use tax to the state.

If you are selling on the Internet to states around the country, you now will need to be aware of which states have enacted laws requiring the collection of sales tax by online sellers.
