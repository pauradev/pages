[**Payment process**](https://blog.printaura.com/modular-page-inject/payment_process) 

* Time Of Sale: Payments for one-time orders or samples can be paid for at the time of sale. Please note that this functionality is currently offered over the phone only, but will be available through the website soon.
* Credit Card on Record: Future E-commerce merchants will be required to have a credit card or linked paypal account on record to use commercial level accounts.
* Automatic Payments: You can setup auto payments and not have to worry about a thing. When the order enters Printaura we will charge your credit card or Paypal account for the exact amount of the order. Cancelling automatic payments without an account balance may result in commercial account suspension.
* Manually Deposit Funds: If an order is sent to us and you do not have automatic billing setup we will send you an email that your order will be on hold and no further orders will be processed until payment is made. You will be prompted to deposit funds into your Printaura account by credit card or Paypal. We offer several options to E-commerce merchants to transfer larger payments at via lower fee methods. Please contact support directly for more information **+1(916)668-0677**.
