<h2>Fantastic News!</h2>

We are excited to offer some of the highest quality cell phone cases on the market, paired with an industry leading 3D printing process. From corner to corner, and edge to edge, our seamless in-surface printing technology leaves no outer surface untouched. Bright, colorful inks are embedded deeply into the surface of the case underneath a clear protective finish, so that your case will look fresh and new as long as you have it. These phone cases will outlast your phone! Available in five different styles, our cases are durable as well as fade and scratch resistant.

Our new cases are made of space-grade plastics (seriously .. they use this stuff on space shuttles). The cases are coated with highly-scratch resistant finishes that protect against wear and tear and scratching.

<h2>New Printing Process</h2>
We are not just excited about our new, higher quality, more stylish cases. We are super excited about our new printing process that will yield higher quality prints. The matte cases are vivid and true to color, and gloss cases are out of this world! 

Our new cases are printed using 3D dye sublimation. Each case is vacuum formed to the printing equipment. Your artwork will be printed on a transfer film (not paper) using high quality specialized inks. The printing system heats up the case and the film is overlaid onto it. The vacuum sucks the film down around the edges of the case. The extreme heat converts the ink to gas and that passes into the surface of the case.

<h3> Finishes </h3>

Our new matte case option features a flat and soft finish. The colors are just as vibrant, but the case is reflection free! The gloss finish provides a shiny and glossy case with vivid colors.
