<h4>Intermediate Photoshop Tutorial Roundup</h4>
We've put together some really helpful Photoshop tutorials that will definitely step up your design game. These tutorials are for those of you who already have a good understanding of the basics in Photoshop. If you are new to using Photoshop, check out our <a href="https://printaura.com/beginners-photoshop-tutorial-roundup/" target="_blank">Beginners Photoshop Tutorial Roundup</a> for videos to help you with the basics.
<h3>Using The Pen Tool</h3>
In the beginners tutorials, we showed you how to remove a background using a combination of easy to use tools. While it's easy to remove a background using the magic wand, it isn't always super accurate. Learning to use the pen tool is a great skill to add to your design toolbox. It can be a bit hard to get used to, but it gives you the most amount of control over what is selected.

<h3>How To Create A Halftone Pattern</h3>
Using gradients in Photoshop is an easy way to create a fade effect. Unfortunately, gradients don’t translate well when it comes to printing. We suggest you learn how to create halftone patterns if your design requires a fade effect. It takes some practice to use this correctly, so play around with it!

<h3>Create A Double Exposure Effect</h3>
This design effect can be seen on posters, album covers, t-shirts, and more. It’s very popular at the moment and can turn photographs into amazing digital art. This is just a great design skill to have. It can be a lot of fun to play around with and work into your designs. The tutorial goes by pretty quickly. I suggest doing the steps along with the video, and pausing between tasks.

<h4>Adding Images To Text</h4>
Yes, this video is pretty corny, but the concept is illustrated well. You can use this technique in a variety ways. It doesn’t have to be for a “tacky holiday card.”
