<h4>Free Design Resources</h4>
It wasn't long ago that I was in a similar to position to many of you. I had a passion for design, but was just starting out. My budget was tight but my desire to create was strong. Luckily it keeps getting easier to come across good quality graphic resources for free. You just have to know where to look for them. It took me a while to find the places that never let me down! I hope to save you all some time and share the places I always turn to when I am looking for a new font or the prefect graphic touch to compliment a new design.
<h3>Mind The Licenses</h3>
It's very important to play close attention to licensing for free resources.

<strong>Personal Use Only</strong>
Some free resources only include a personal license. This type of license means it is NOT okay to use the resource in your designs or marketing of your designs.

<strong>Commercial Use </strong>
This type of license means it is okay for you to use the resource in the marketing of your designs, and if noted, in your designs as well. If it does not state that you may use the resource for items intended for resell, make sure you inquire to ensure it is a legal use of the resource.

If you aren't sure what license is included with the free download, reach out to the creator of the resource and just ask!
