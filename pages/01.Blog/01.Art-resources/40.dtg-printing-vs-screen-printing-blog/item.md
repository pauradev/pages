<h2>DTG Printing</h2>
DTGÂ  printing, also referred to as direct to garment printing, is a method used to print digital imagery onto t-shirts and other fabrics. DTG printing is the method we use most frequently here at Print Aura. Direct to garment printing is just what it sounds like; the design is directly printed onto the garment. We use large specialized printers and inks to print designs directly onto fabrics.

<h3>How It Works</h3>
Curious about how DTG printing works? The process is quite simple and yields beautiful results, as long as the digital art is setup correctly. Here is what happens:

1. The printer is set up in accordance with your desired placement and product.

2. Your design is sent to the printer.

3. The printer transfers your design onto the product.

4. The ink is then sealed in order to promote product longevity. 

5. And we're done. Easy!

<h3>Pros</h3>
There are many benefits to using DTG printing for your needs. Here are just a few:

<h2>Screen Printing</h2>

Screen printing, also referred to as silk screening is another method for printing graphics on t-shirts and other fabrics. Screen printing is a printing process that goes back thousands of years.

<h3>How It Works</h3>
Curious about how screen printing works? The set up process for screen printing is a very technical process. After the screen is setup with your design, many prints can be made from that one screen. Here is what happens: 

1. Your design is transferred onto a fine mesh screen using a photo emulsion process.

2. The press is then setup in accordance with your desired positioning and product.

3. A squeegee is then used to push a thick ink through the stenciled mesh.

4. When the screen is lifted, voila! Your design has been transferred onto your product.
