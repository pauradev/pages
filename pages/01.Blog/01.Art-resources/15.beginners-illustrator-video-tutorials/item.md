<h4>Illustrator Vs. Photoshop</h4>

I was always really into photography, even as a young child. In the fourth grade I was in the dark room developing my own film. After digital photography made it's debut, I got myself a digital camera and purchased a program called Photoshop. I taught myself to use this program and became very familiar with all of its tools. Years later I became interested in graphic design. I was very stubborn and refused to learn to use Illustrator. The tools seemed the same .. but different at the same time. Instead of adding a new program to my repertoire, I just found ways to do similar things in Photoshop. 

At a certain point though .. there were just things Photoshop couldn't do. While you can do a lot in Photoshop, it was originally created for photographic editing, and not graphic design. Its original purpose is obvious in it's limitations with graphic design. I eventually gave in and started teaching myself to use Illustrator. I haven't looked back since! 

<h3>Getting Started With Illustrator</h3>

Using Illustrator for the first time can feel intimidating and overwhelming, even if you are familiar with Photoshop. Don't let that initial feeling turn you away from learning to use this program. There are some great features that are perfect for creating designs for print and branding.
