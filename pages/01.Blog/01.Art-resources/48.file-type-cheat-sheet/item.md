If you aren’t very familiar with graphic design, you probably aren’t too familiar with different file types, what they mean, and how they are different.

When it comes to creating images for print, file type becomes very important. You will notice we ask for specific file types for different products. It’s not because we are trying to make things difficult, we swear! We just want to make sure your print looks as great as it possibly can, and using the correct file types can help ensure that.

Here is everything you wanted to know and more about file types!
<h2>Raster Files Vs. Vector Files</h2>
You may have heard these terms thrown around and haven’t been sure what to make of them.
<h3><span style="color: #008080;">Raster Files</span></h3>
A raster file is made up of thousands of squares of color information we refer to as “pixels”. We usually edit raster files in programs like Adobe Photoshop.

<strong>Pros</strong>
Raster files are great for photographs and images that have complex color profiles or effects applied. This file type provides rich detail and precise editing.

<strong>Cons</strong>
A raster files have a set height and width. If you want to enlarge or shrink this image, quality may be lost. When you try to increase the size of raster image it will get blurry because you are just increasing the size of those squares (pixels) we talked about.

<strong>Usual file types:</strong> JPEG/JPG, PSD, PNG, TIFF
<h3><span style="color: #008080;">Vector Files</span></h3>
A vector file is made up of points, lines, and curves. Your computer uses math to connect the points and fill in anything that’s missing. We usually edit vector files in programs like Adobe Illustrator.

<strong>Pros</strong>
Vector files have an unlimited potential for height and width adjustment without loss of quality. You can enlarge and shrink these files and they will remain crisp and clean. Vectors are great for logos and other illustrations that could be used in a variety of sizes.

They are also easy to edit because the different shapes will always remain separate. You can change the size and color of any shape at any time.

<strong>Cons</strong>
Vector files come up short when dealing with complex images that require complex coloring. Vectors also cannot support some effects like blurring or drop shadows.

<strong>Usual file types:</strong> AI, EPS
<h2>File Type Cheat Sheet</h2>
We have listed a variety of common file types below. You will learn what each of these file types stand for, their best uses, and some features that are specific to each individual file type. We hope this helps clear things up a bit!
