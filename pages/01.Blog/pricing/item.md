<h1>Contract Printing Prices</h1>

[tab_item title="Price Wizard"]
<h3>Use the wizard below to estimate* the cost of a printed product</h3>
<em>*The default price estimates listed reflect the shirt price for sizes XL and smaller, with a single standard print (12"x16"), and do not include shipping.  Actual prices will vary based on the options you select and for sizes 2XL and up.  Please note in step 3 that there is an additional charge for printing on both sides of the shirt. Colored shirts require an <a href="https://printaura.com/understanding-white-label-branding-your-products/">under-base</a> and therefore have an additional cost.</em>

Below are our shipping options for our print on demand products.
<h3>T-Shirts &amp; Garments</h3>
Items that are on a separate line are shipped in separate packages due to the nature of the how the products are packaged and shipped. The exception are sweatshirts which can ship with t-shirts, bags, phone cases, and beanies but the base price will be the sweatshirt 1st item price and then any items from the other group of products will be charged the additional item charge for that group.

<strong>The list of countries where tracking + delivery confirmation is returned are:</strong>
Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South, Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.

All other countries provide tracking but not delivery confirmation. Services may be provided or discontinued to certain countries/regions by at any time and at the sole discretion of the manufacturer. Rates subject to change based on market fluctuations.
