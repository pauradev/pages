## It’s Mug Season!
It could be argued that it’s always mug season, but they sure come in handy during this time of the year. The streets here are dusted in snow and hot beverages are essential! Whether you are getting your day started at home, or sipping on something throughout the day at the office, mugs are a must. If you don’t already offer mugs in your shop, you should certainly consider it!
