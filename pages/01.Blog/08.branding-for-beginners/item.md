Let's talk about branding! 

===
First of all, let's make sure we are all on the same page. We are working under the assumption that you've already begun to develop your brand. Hopefully you've read our article, "[Branding Basics: How To Start Building You Brand](https://blog.printaura.com/blog/tutorials/branding-basics-how-to-start-building-your-brand)". If you haven't, you might want to check it out! There we break down branding basics like how to devlop your brand's identity and how to acheive consistency. Here, we will be diving a bit deeper into the branding options that are available to you as a Print Aura member. 

Let's say you've gone through all the trouble to develop your branding on a digital level. You've figured out your brand's identity, your logo is finally perfect, and your website and product pages are looking on point. Now, selling and sending out unbranded shirts can undo a lot of that work. We live in an age of (distractability - ADD) and poor retetion. Let's say a first time customer finds your shop, buys a t-shirt, get's it in the mail, and tosses out the packaging and packing slip. What is there left on the product to signify where they purchased this garment from? A few months from now, do you think they will be able to recall? What if a friend, family member, or passerby admire the shirt and wants to know? 

There are plenty of online strategies you can employ to build relationships with your customers and up return sales (we will go over this in another article). However, on a purely real physical world level, there's a lot you can to do to brand your items so people will remember where they got it from.  

Hang Tags 
Hang tags are a great way to add some personality and brand visibility to your products. Though they will be thrown away before the customer's first use, it's a great way to make a good and lasting impression. 

Neck Labels 
These are important because they are here to stay. Print Aura can remove existing garment branding, and add a neck label of your design. This way, when someone checks branding on the neck label, they will see your brand, and not Gildan or Next Level Apparel. 

Pack-ins
Pack-ins are a great way to spark a relationship with your customer to let them know that you care. Add an extra little goody to show your apprecaition, or a sale coupon off their next order. The possibilities are limitless!
