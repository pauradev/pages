<h4>How Does Embroidery Work?</h4>
Embroidery is a decorative technique used to create designs on fabric. This technique involves the weaving of thread to create shapes and words. Embroidery looks elegant and is distinguishable by it’s raised and textured qualities.

If you are using Print Aura for your embroidery work, the steps are as follows:

<ul>
	<li>First, you will need to download one of our embroidery templates - found under the artwork requirements tab of the <a href="https://printaura.com/embroidery" target="_blank">embroidery page</a>.</li>


	<li>Next, you will need to add your design to the art space provided, using the color swatches provided. The colors provided in the template represent the colors of thread that are available for embroidery.</li>


	<li>You then send your design to us to have it digitized.</li>


	<li>The digitizer converts your images into a language that is readable by the embroidery machine. </li>


	<li>The digitized image is sent to the embroidery machine.</li>


	<li>The embroidery machine uses the colors of threads specified in the shapes and fonts you have chosen to embroider your design on a product.</ul></li>

<h4>Do’s and Don'ts of Embroidery Design</h4>
Creating a design for embroidery can actually be quite difficult. It’s much different than direct to garment printing and screen printing. Since the design is being sewed on, there are some design limitations that need to be taken into account. Certain shapes, details, and fonts, are too complicated or nuanced to be created using thread. Here are some do’s and dont’s to help you create a great embroidery design.

<h3>Using The Embroidery Template</h3>
There are several things that need to be taken into consideration when adding your artwork to the embroidery template. Here are some tips to help you stay on track:

<h4>Do</h4>

<span style="color: #008000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-plus"></span></span> Consider the size of the artwork space. The artwork space is only around 5 inches wide and 2 inches tall. If you want a discernible design, make sure to use the entire height of the space.

<span style="color: #008000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-plus"></span></span> Use the color swatches provided at the bottom of the template. These colors represent the colors of thread that are available.

<span style="color: #008000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-plus"></span></span> Consider contrast when choosing colors. For example, use dark colors on light hats and light colors on dark hats.

<span style="color: #008000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-plus"></span></span> Use simple shapes.

<h4>Don’t</h4>

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-no"></span></span> Use a small amount of the artwork space provided. If you only use half of the height of the space provided, your design will only be around 1 inch tall.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-no"></span></span> Use colors other than the colors provided in the template.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-no"></span></span> Use similar colors to the color of the product you have chosen. For example, don't use black, dark gray, or dark blue on a dark hat.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-no"></span></span> Use overly complex or detailed shapes.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-no"></span></span> Use shadows or shading.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-no"></span></span> Use color gradients.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-no"></span></span> Put large outlines around your designs. The outlines take up a huge amount of your allotted thread count.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-no"></span></span> Use photographs

<h3>Choosing Fonts For Embroidery</h3>
Choosing a font for embroidery can be difficult. Many fonts that look great when printed might not translate well for embroidery work. Here are some tips to help you choose fonts that will come out great:

<h4>Do</h4>

<span style="color: #008000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-plus"></span></span> Choose a <a href="https://printaura.com/font-glossary/" target="_blank">sans serif font</a>

<span style="color: #008000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-plus"></span></span> Choose an easily legible font.

<span style="color: #008000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-plus"></span></span> Choose a font that has a decent amount of space between characters.

<span style="color: #008000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-plus"></span></span> Choose a clean font without distressed or stylistic features.

<span style="color: #008000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-plus"></span></span> Choose a font that is at least ½ inch high.

<span style="color: #008000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-plus"></span></span> Stay within the thread count guidelines.

<h4>Don’t</h4>

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-no"></span></span> Choose a font with pronounced <a href="https://printaura.com/font-glossary/" target="_blank">serifs</a>

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-no"></span></span> Choose a hard to read font.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-no"></span></span> Choose a detailed font.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-no"></span></span> Choose a font with distressed or stylistic features.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-no"></span></span> Choose a font that has letters very close together.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="dashicons dashicons-no"></span></span> Choose a font that is under ½ inch.
