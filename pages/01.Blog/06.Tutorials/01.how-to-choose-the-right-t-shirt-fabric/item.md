Print Aura offers many t-shirt brands that feature different fabric options. The variety of fabric is great if you know what you are looking for. However, it can be a little confusing and intimidating if you arenâ€™t sure what the difference is.

We know most people aren't fabric experts, so we put together this handy little fabrics cheat sheet. Hopefully the information below will help you decide which fabric options work best for your t-shirts.
<h4>How To Choose The Right T-Shirt Fabric</h4>
There are a few things you will want to consider before choosing the fabric for your t-shirts. You should be thinking about what the material is, how it feels, and how the fabric is designed to be used.
<h3><strong>Cotton</strong></h3>
<strong>Description:</strong> this fabric is made from the cotton plant. It is one of the most commonly desired fabrics because of its pleasant feel against the skin.
<strong>Feel:</strong> Soft and lightweight
<strong>Best Uses:</strong> Everyday use
<h3>Cotton Terminology</h3>
Here are some terms you might see used to describe cotton fabrics.

<strong>Ring Spun Cotton:</strong> This term refers to how the cotton yarn is made. Ring spun cotton is made using a twisting technique. The twisting results in a stronger and softer fabric.
<strong>Jersey: </strong>This term refers to the knit type of the garment. Jersey is light weight and single knit. Jersey can be used to describe other fabrics as well.

<h3><strong>Polyester</strong></h3>
<strong>Description:</strong> this fabric is a manufactured material that is strong, quick drying, and wrinkle resistant. It holds its shape very well and holds up well after washing. Modern polyester is a very useful and comfortable fabric.
<strong>Feel:</strong> Polyester can have a slightly synthetic feel to some people.
