<h2>What Is A Platform?</h2>
When we refer to a platform, we are simply referring to an eCommerce software or website that allows you to sell things online. Shopify is a platform. Etsy is platform. Different platforms offer different things. Some platforms have marketplaces already established where you can sell your goods. Some platforms will allow you to have your own stand alone website. Some platforms will take a percentage of your sales, and some charge flat rates. Some platforms allow a lot of design freedom, and some are confined. There is a lot to consider when choosing the platform that is right for you and your brand.
