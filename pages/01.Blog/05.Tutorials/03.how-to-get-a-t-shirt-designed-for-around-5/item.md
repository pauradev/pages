Today we are going to be talking about outsourcing custom t-shirt designs! Not everyone is a brilliant artist and not everyone is skilled at creating digital art. Personally, I love photography and I love to draw, but that’s about where my artistic talent ends. I am certainly lacking in the digital art department.

Just because I am lacking those skills doesn’t mean I can’t start up a t-shirt business! There are ways to sell t-shirt designs without having a mastery of digital art software.

I know what you are thinking, "I don’t know .. that sounds expensive! I don’t want to spend a ton of money for designs!" Well not to worry my friend, you can actually do it on the cheap a couple of different ways.

All you really need is an idea for a shirt that you think people would buy!
<h2>Using Fiverr</h2>
Fiverr is a website where you can get a lot of different freelance services done at a cheap price. People offer their services starting around 5 dollars. On Fiverr you can find logo design, illustration, graphic design, photo editing, and a whole lot more! You can even find people who will help you clean up your own designs to ensure they are print ready!

<h3>Some Tips For Using Fiverr</h3>
Make sure they have plenty of examples and positive reviews. Because frankly, sometimes you really get what you pay for on this site.

Make sure you pay attention to whether or not revisions to the design are included. More often than not, you will want to revise or change something about the design. Check out how many revisions you get, and if they cost extra.

Be as specific as possible when you describe what you want. Talk about colors, style, font choices if you are including text, and anything else you can think of. The more descriptive you are the better chance the design will be what you have envisioned.

Check out our <em><a href="https://printaura.com/image-requirements/" target="_blank">image requirements</a></em> FIRST. You want to make sure they understand your image requirements before they start your design.

If you have Illustrator or Photoshop, it can be helpful to request an editable image. Sometimes it costs extra for them, but it can be worth it if you understand how to edit images.

Make sure their design examples look cohesive. If someone has a bunch of examples, and they all look like they were designed by different people, they probably were. You want to find someone who has consistent designs so you know what to expect.
<h2>Design Stock</h2>
I am a big fan of stock art and photography. Stock images aren't always $5 but you can find some pretty high quality imagery for around that price! Stock is great because you can either use it as your design and be done, or you can do what I love doing and gather multiple stock elements to create a new design. The only catch with stock is that you have to pay very close attention to the licensing. Sometimes you are allowed to use an image for marketing, which is great, but you aren’t allowed to use it for re-sale. So just make sure with whatever stock service you are using, that you are allowed to profit from / resell the images. You can find really high quality images to use or to play with!
