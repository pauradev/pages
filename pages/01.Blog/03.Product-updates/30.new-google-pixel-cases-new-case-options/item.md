<h3>An Honest Review</h3>
I have been trying out one of our tough cases on my personal phone for a few months now in order to make sure the quality was there for our customers. I wanted to see if these cases could stand up to the punishment I put my phone through. If they could handle my daily life, they will handle just about anyone's life! I usually have a very heavy duty case around my delicate iPhone, and was honestly a little bit nervous for my phone. I am a trail runner, a whitewater rafter, and a clumsy person in general. Needless to say, my phone and my phone case go through the ringer on a weekly basis.

<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>The Verdict</strong></span>

I can say in complete honesty, I have been thoroughly impressed with our tough case. I am not just talking about the looks of it! I have dropped my phone on just about every surface you can think of .. concrete, table tops, asphalt, mud puddles, rocks, and more. There isn't a single scratch on my phone, or the case! The print still looks like it did the day I got it. I love our tough case and am so happy to be able to offer such an awesome product!
