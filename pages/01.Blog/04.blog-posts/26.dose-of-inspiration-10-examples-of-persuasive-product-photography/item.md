<center><h4>Dose of Inspiration: Part 3
10 Persuasive Product Photographs</center></h4>

When it comes to marketing and sales, image is everything. I am not just talking about your brand's image, or even your image as the owner. I am talking specifically about product imagery. Product photography, and how you present your products to the public, can have a huge impact on your ability to sell that product, especially online. Since we live in the world of eCommerce, a image is worth a thousand words. 

You should be using you product photography as an opportunity to sell. It's not about just getting all the angles, though that does help. The best product photography evokes a positive feeling for the online consumer. It creates an emotional connection to the product. Can the consumer <strong>imagine</strong> themselves wearing or using your product? Do they want to be part of the imagery you are presenting? 

<strong>If you can create a connection to a desirable emotion or lifestyle in your photos that appeals to your target market, you are golden!  </strong>

Check out these 10 product photos that do just that. 

<em><h3>1. Valchemy Lab (Via Urban Outfitters)</h3>
