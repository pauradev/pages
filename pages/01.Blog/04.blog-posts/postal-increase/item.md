### **U.S. Postal rate hike**

On January 27th The U.S. Postal Service is instituting itsâ€™ largest price increase in history. The cost of postage for a first class letter is going up by 10%, there is a corresponding increase for packages. As a result, PrintAura is forced to increase our shipping rates. Every effort has been made to hold our pricing to under a 10% increase while making shipping calculations as easy as possible for everyone. Starting February 1st, PrintAura will be raising the rate for shipping individual items by $0.50 and multiple items by $0.25. For example: the shipping rate of an individual T-shirt will increase from $5.00 to $5.50 and an additional item will ship for $1.25 opposed to $1.00.


PrintAura selected the U.S. Postal Service as our preferred carrier based on their exemplary cost and performance. Many Industry printers use a hybrid system that uses a third party to transport the material part way, then the Postal Service to deliver it to the home. While this saves money, it can add as much as 7 days to the overall delivery time. PrintAura recognizes that your customers don't want to wait an extra week to receive your products. By using our current system 95% of our packages are delivered in 2-3 days. This makes it possible for us to have the product in your customers' hands within a week of the time they place an order. Expedient delivery is important to our customers, as well as your customers' happiness.
