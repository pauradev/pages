Selling T-Shirts online is a great business and can be a lot of fun. It can also be very lucrative and rewarding if promoted properly. In a sea of thousands of online t-shirt stores, you have to find a way to stand out. Starting a t-shirt company from scratch can be a daunting task, but we are here and happy to help!
<h4>Here are 9 ways to promote your t-shirt brand</h4>
<h3>1. Identify Your Target Market</h3>
Your designs have a voice, whether you realize it or not. Figure out what kind of people gravitate towards your designs or figure out who you want to sell to, and design for them. You might have a very wide target market, or you may have a very specific niche. Whatever the case, if you can identify them you can market to them more effectively.
<h3>2. Build Your Brand</h3>
Establishing your brand’s identity is very important. Successful branding creates an experience around the brand and the products. It should fit together seamlessly and maintain consistency. Your brand identity should also reflect and speak to your target market. Your brand should have a voice. Think about what it will say about your products.

After you are confident about your branding vision, make it a reality by branding your products! <a href="https://printaura.com/12-inspiring-hang-tag-designs/" target="_blank">Hang tags</a>, stickers, <a href="https://printaura.com/how-to-build-your-brand-using-pack-ins/" target="_blank">pack-ins</a>, neck labels, and packaging can all help complete your branding vision.

<h3>3. Set Your Shop Up For Success</h3>
When it comes to your shop setup, looks do matter. You want to make sure your shop is clean, well organized, well designed, and reflects the overall theme and feeling of your brand. A poorly designed shop will send people running for hills. Whether you like it or not, your shop reflects your brand. If your shop looks outdated, disorganized, and poorly designed, so will you.
<h3>4. Sales &amp; Promotions</h3>
Everybody loves to feel like they are getting deal. Creating and promoting sales can be a great way to draw in new customers, or get that person that’s been on the fence to finally buy. Just do your math and make sure the sale you want to do is feasible for you financially.

<strong>Sale Examples:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Spend More, Save More: 10% off 1 item, 20% off 2 items, 30% off 3 items</li>
	<li>Free Standard Shipping</li>
	<li>Buy 4 Shirts, Get 1 Free</li>
	<li>Free Gift With Order over $30</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Be Social</h3>
Create accounts for your brand on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, and anything else you feel comfortable maintaining. Social networks are a great way to get the word out about your brand, promote your products, and keep people updated. Post photos of new designs, ask for people’s feedback, connect with your customers. It takes a while for anyone to build up these accounts, so don’t feel discouraged if it’s slow to start. Just keep with it and post meaningful content with your target market in mind.
<h3>6. Contests &amp; Giveaways</h3>
Holding contests or giveaways can be a great way to reach new people and keep your current customers engaged. The more value you can provide to people, the more interested they will be in your brand. For example, you can do a giveaway on Facebook after you hit [x] amount of likes, or set up a contest people can enter by liking your page. Contests and giveaways bring new people to your pages and get them to engage with your brand!
<h3>7. Reach Out To Influencers</h3>
A great way to get the word out about your brand is to reach out to the opinion leaders in your market. If you can get popular bloggers, Youtubers, or relevant credible sites to feature or mention your products, that reach goes a long way! But don’t just approach them expecting them to do you a favor. You will get a further through the door if you can offer up some mutually beneficial situation.
<h3>8. Create Content</h3>
Creative and unique content can drive traffic to your store. Value isn’t just monetary, it can be intellectual too! Write about things you think your target market will find useful, helpful, or entertaining. Good content can also promote you brand identity and give you a sense of legitimacy. It also helps with SEO!
<h3>9. Let Your Personality &amp; Passion Shine Through</h3>
People buy from people. Let your personality shine through in your designs and your marketing. Passion is energy, and if you let people see your passion, they will feel that energy and get excited too.

T-shirts reflect people’s personalities. If you are passionate about your designs, odds are people just like you will be too.
