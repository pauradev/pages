Deciding which products to offer in your store can be overwhelming, especially if you are just starting out. Luckily for Print Aura members, there are lots of products to choose from, and no penalty if your products don’t sell. With that being said, there are some important things to consider when choosing which products to offer in your store.
<h2>How To Choose The Right Products For Your Store</h2>
<h3>Think About Your Brand</h3>
First things first, let’s think about your brand. You want to make sure the products you offer are in line with your brand identity. If you aren’t sure what your brand’s identity is, it’s a good idea to stop and think about this first. Your brand should have a consistent feel and personality. Your brand identity should carry over to the products you offer. For example, if your brand is all about how great America is, it would be smart to offer American made products. If your brand is all about office humor, you better have a mug or two in your store!
<h3>Think About Your Customers</h3>
Who is your target market? In other words, who are the people you are selling to? Think about who will gravitate towards your designs while you consider which products to offer. Are your designs all about great grandmas? If so, you probably don’t want to offer thin or sheer shirts that are geared towards a younger crowd. If you are selling to college students, don’t offer super expensive items. Go a step further and talk to people who are in your target market. Ask them which products they would be interested in. If there are products that keep coming up, you'd be smart to offer those items in your store.

<strong>Here are some things to consider when deciding which apparel items to offer to your customers:</strong>

<span class="dashicons dashicons-yes"></span>Fit
<span class="dashicons dashicons-yes"></span>Style
<span class="dashicons dashicons-yes"></span>Price
<span class="dashicons dashicons-yes"></span>Color Options
<span class="dashicons dashicons-yes"></span>Sheerness
<span class="dashicons dashicons-yes"></span>Fabric

<h3>Think About Your Art</h3>
While keeping your brand and your customers in mind, let’s think about what kind of products you see your art on. Posters, t-shirts, and pillows are great items to start out with if your designs are illustration based. If your designs are more typography based, mugs, pillows, t-shirts, and hats are good items to try out. You might even get inspired and create new designs for specific items.
<h3>Consider Trending Items</h3>
Following trends in your market can be profitable. However, trends can also be regrettable and fleeting. Before you give into any market trends, think about if they are in line with your designs and your brand. If you are in love with a trend and it fits in with your store, then go for it. If you aren’t into it and you aren't sure where it would fit into your store, then leave it alone.
<h3>Test Products Out</h3>
If you are a Print Aura member, you’re one lucky seller! Since we are a print on demand service, you can add products to your store without any of the risk you would face if you were going at it alone. You don’t need to worry about a product not selling since we only charge you for the items you sell. If a product doesn’t sell well, or doesn't sell at all, there is no penalty.

Since you have the opportunity, we highly recommend testing out different products to see which ones sell better. You can try out as many products as you want since you don’t have to worry about any overhead, stock issues, or pesky minimums. If an item isn't selling, simply remove it and replace it with another. You can continue to do this until your shop is full of best sellers.
