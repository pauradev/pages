<h2>What Is A “Pack-In”?</h2>
We've been getting a lot of questions about "pack-ins" lately, so we decided it was time we wrote a blog on the subject! So what is a "pack-in"?

A <strong>“pack-in”</strong> is an item you include with your shipments as a bonus! A pack-in is usually an inexpensive, fun, promotional item like a flyer, a sticker, a patch, or a button.
<h2>How To Build Your Brand Using “Pack-Ins”</h2>
Including a "pack-in" with your orders is a great way to promote your brand and establish a positive identity with your customer. Unexpected surprises can be quite endearing!
<h3><strong>Make It Personal</strong></h3>
Pack-ins are a great way to show your customers you appreciate their business and care about them on a personal level. Including a personal touch like a hand written or signed thank you card can leave a lasting impression. It shows you went out of your way to show your appreciation. It lets your customers know they are not just a meaningless purchase in a sea of consumers.
<h3><strong>Let It Speak For Your Brand</strong></h3>
Use a pack-in to show your customers what your brand is all about. Let’s say you specialize in selling different types of “I love my (insert dog breed)” shirts and mugs. A pack-in can be a great way to attribute positive thoughts and feelings to your brand. For this example, you'd want to let people know you love dogs too! Including a small packaged treat or toy for your customers dog would do the trick. Those gestures don’t go unnoticed.
<h3><strong>Make It Shareable</strong></h3>
Use a pack-in to get the word out about your brand. Including an item that people will want to show off or share is a great way to spread the word about your brand. Stickers can be a cheap and easy way to accomplish this. Let’s go back to the dog example. As a dog lover, think of something you would want to put on your car, laptop, or water bottle. For example, a sticker of a heart with a paw in it (don't forget to include your logo). Think about your customer and what your market is. If they are buying a shirt to tell the world how much they love their dog, they will most likely want to share their love using a sticker too!
